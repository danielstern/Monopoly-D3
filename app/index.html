  <h1>
    The Monopoly Data Science Strategy Guide
  </h1>
  <h4>
    Assumptions
  </h4>
  <p>
    Rate of return is calculated on the basis that the property is landed on once per turn, and the rate of return is per turn. These can be any numbers, (for example, 10 turns.)
  </p>
  <p>
    Certain squares have a higher probability of being landed on than others.
    For example, Boardwalk has a 2.62% chance of being landed upon, while Park Place has a 2.18% chance of being landed upon.
    This may not seem significant, but you are 20% more likely to land on Boardwalk than Park Place.
    squares, like Reading Railroad, have a higher chance than others of being landed
  </p>
  <p>

    <h2>
    Odds of Ending Up on Each Property vs Average
  </h2>
  <div id="probabilities"> </div>
  <ul>
    <li>
      There are 40 squares on a monopoly board, so the base odds of landing on any one square is 2.5%.
    </li>
    <li>
      You can never end up on Go to Jail, since it always takes you to jail. Thus, the odds of ending up on Jail are also more than twice the average.
    </li>
    <li>
      The probability of ending up on the properties that come shortly after jail is better than the rest (starting with orange.)
    </li>
  </ul>

  </p>
  <h2>
    Monopoly Prices By Color
  </h2>
    <div id="main"></div>
  <ul>
    <li>
      The biggest jump is between dark purple and teal, and blue
    </li>
    <li>
      Utilities and railroads find themselves somewhere beneath the cost curve.
    </li>
    <li>
      Every color but purple has different prices within it.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>
    Rate of Return with one house
  </h2>
  <div id="roi"></div>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Even considering their advanced house prices, the higher end has a better rate of return for just one
    </li>
    <li>
      The rate of return for one house on Mediterranean Avenue is really bad
    </li>
    <li>
      Other than at the ends, all is more or less the same
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>
    Rate of Return with Three Houses
  </h2>
  <div id="roi2"></div>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Interestingly, both the Green colors underperform in this category.
    </li>
    <li>
      Boardwalk has 3x more ROI with three houses than Mediterranean
    </li>
  </ul>


  <h2>
    Rate of Return with a Hotel
  </h2>
  <div id="roi3"></div>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Strangely, the curve is much different than with 3 houses
    </li>
    <li>
      Rate of returns are good on the cheaper half of the board, and bad on the expensive half, when you have a hotel.
    </li>
    <li>
      As always, Mediterranean Avenue is a weak performer
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>
    Cost to Develop Whole Colors
  </h2>
  <div id="whole"></div>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Shockingly, the cost to develop Green to hotel status is over $3,500. This is almost enough to buy the entire board.
    </li>
  </ul>
